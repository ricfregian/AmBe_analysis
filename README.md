# AmBe_analysis
#cluster_analysis.py and waveform_analysis.py
This set of python scripts read information from ROOT files, apply cuts, and produce plots. Each reads a different tree in the ROOT file produced by the PhaseIITreeMaker.cpp of the ANNIE analysis framework. 

#bkg_model.py
This script is in progress. This will be used to model the background of the AmBe data. This is based in Teal Pershing's modeling described in his Phd. Thesis.
